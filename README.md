# To-do List

For creating a to-do list manager in python using tkinter.

## tkinter

tkinter is a requirement. You can install it by running 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### To-do
- make a new branch for upcoming changes
- change from txt file to some json file or something
- probably need an item class
- maybe a sub-item class too
- add a panel to display the items in the list in more detail
- add IDs to items (How do I generate IDs?)
